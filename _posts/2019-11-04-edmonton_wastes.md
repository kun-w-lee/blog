## Project:

With the use of Tableau, I decided to make a project that shows whether the **amount of waste produced by peerson is decreasing or increasing**.

## Why?

The preservation of environment is a great issue among the world in current time, and as a student in the faculty of environment, I wish to find out whether the process of the protection is working positively or negatively.

## How? Source?

To answer the goal of this project, I compared the amount of waste produced by person in Edmonton each year and see the pattern of the increase or the decrease of the waste production.

I used the dataset produced by the [City of Edmonton owned by the 'The Way We Green Email](https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/Environmental-Services/Waste-Produced-per-Person/wj9w-kkrb), which includes the variables such as, years, total tonnes of waste collected, total tonnes of recycling collected, kg of waste per capita, and population in Edmonton. The type of the data is CSV Document file, and it is stored internally. There are about 80 records stored and is a temporal data since the database stores data relating to time instances.

## Product

In order to answer the topic, “are we making the progress in preserving the Earth by lessening to toxic garbage,” I decided to first check whether if people in Edmonton are producing more recyclable wastes compared to the overall wastes. However, as it shows in the graph, the number of recyables did not increase, but decreased compared to the increase of overall wastes.

To verify whether the overall wastes is incerasing, I added the population data.

Through the graph2, it was shown that the total wastes collected is relevant to the population.

Therefore, I was able to find out that the increase of wastes is only due to the increase of population.

Lastly, I decided to look at the amount of garbage produced by each person by comparing the years and kg of waste per capita and total waste.

The data resulted in showing that although the total waste increased, each person tried to lessen the amount of garbage.

## Conclusion

Overall, through this project, I was able to see that the amount of waste each person produce is decreasing; however, the total waste has increased since the population in Edmonton increased rapidly in 13 years. Nontheless, the amount of recyclable product did not increase compared to the amount of total wastes produced.

Now, it is the time for us to think about how we could further help the environment. Many people are starting to lessen their garbage production, but do not know the way to produce healthier garbages.

Companies, or the governments must start to lessen the non-recylables, and establish more policies for recycling.
