"The Scientists have Found a Parallel Universe", NASA, May 2020.

This argument about the new aspect of the world stared when the Antarctic Base found a strange signal from the ground. Did they really find a parallel world?

## The Neutrinos

Before we get into the subject of this article, we must know what neutrinos are.

The neutrinos are the richest subatomic particles that zip through the cosmos at nearly the speed of light. However, it is difficult to detect the particles because their mass is very low and can barely have interactions with other substances.

As you are reading this blog, the neutrinos are falling down from the universe to our Earth but since they don’t interact with substances most of the time, they just penetrate beneath the Earth. It is estimated that 100 trillion particles are passing through our bodies each second. However, the neutrinos generated by powerful explosions, etc., results in very high energy and allows the contact with other substances. Scientists are trying many different experiments to understand and observe the neutrinos.

## Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna

The most powerful tool we have to observe the neutrinos is ANITA, helium balloons with wireless antenna attached to sensor the secondary particles produced by the contact between the neutrinos from the universe and the antarctic ice.

## Signal from the Other Universe

Coming back to the subject of this blog,

On day, the scientists in the antarctic found an unusual signal from the ANITA's data. The data showed a very high energized neutrinos coming up from the ground, when it is supposed to be coming from the universe. Although, the scientists have researched neutrinos for many years, the such phenomenon was never seen before and was impossible to understand. Some suggested the data to be the ‘dark matter’ or ‘sterile neutrino’; however, was not able to prove and explain the signal’s origin.

## Rumors Spread

When many scientists were discussing about the unexplainable energy sensed at Antactic, several scientists published a paper that suggests an idea of potential of a parallel universe. But the problem was that the press, [Daily Stars](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/nasa-scientists-detect-parallel-universe-21996849) used this research paper to announce that the found of the unusual neutrinos is related to the parallel universe, suggesting that the existence of the symmetric world is the only way to prove the particles’ movements. In other words, they announced that the neutrinos coming up from the ground is the proof of the existing parallel world where the time flows backward.

Since then, many media such as, [New York Post](https://nypost.com/2020/05/19/nasa-finds-evidence-of-parallel-universe-where-time-runs-backward-report/) and [Express](https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1284659/NASA-news-parallel-universe-particles-neutrino-Antarctica-ANITA-study), begun to quote the Daily Stars' article on a large scale.

### Antarctica

However, to refute the theory spreading through the media, the scientists declared that it is one of the most unlikable explanations of the event. Furthermore, the scientists added that the particles sensed by the ANITA was not from the Earth’s ground but was related to the icecap of the Antarctic.

The density of Antarctic is as low as it can become ice, and thus, it can have a certain area under the surface over a wide range. Thus, the scientists were able to explain that the signal from the ANITA was actually a reflected cosmic ray from the area under the surface.

<U>The scientists said:<U/>

The most suspicious part of the ANITA event was that the signal had two unusual characteristics:

> 1.  The signal came up from the ground
> 2.  The particle had very high energy.

In usual, the neutrinos are not able to have the two characteristics. If the neutrinos were from an explosion and contained the highest energy, the Earth was supposed to absorb the particles since the high energized particles contact with other substances. Therefore, the scientists concluded that the phenomenon was not due to the neutrinos.

> However, what’s funny was that not every scientist agreed on the conclusion.

### "Proof on it is"

The other scientists who disagreed on the conclusion argued that the data from ANITA was very clear and had no distortion to be the reflected cosmic ray.

To prove the argument, they used a radio optic to stimulate the reflector below the ground surface of Antarctic in a large scale. The experiment showed that the signal from this area was never clear and always had the distortion. With the result of the experiment, the scientists declared that the signal sensed by the ANITA was not just a usual reflection of the particles from the ground.

Anyway, so far, nothing has been proven. Many scientists are trying their best to prove the particle movements; however, in order to know the accurate answer, other experiments are needed. As part of that, the scientists are preparing devices that can verify the characteristics of the Antarctic ground surface.
