`“Having pointless e-mails can seriously harm the environment”`
Is this true?

---

There are about 2.3 billion e-mail users around the world.
If each user deletes 50 e-mails, 8,625,000GB storage can be saved, which is equivalent to 8,423TB.

## What is that Storage?

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Although we cannot see with our two eyes, enormous data are continuously traveling around through the LAN wires,.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0;">All the data are stored in a place called the data center, which is country and companies have several or dozens of them.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">The data center is never turned off, and because they infinite heats, lots of coolers are activated as well.</p>

To run the data center and the cooler, they use 32kwh of energy for 1GB of storage.

Coming back to the e-mail part, 50 e-mails deleted by each user around the world can save 8,423TB, which means it saves 276,000,000kwh energy.
`It is as if turning off 2.7 billion lights for 1 hour.`
