<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">There are about **2.3 billion e-mail users** around the world.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0;">If each user deletes 50 e-mails, 8,625,000GB storage can be saved, which is equivalent to 8,423TB.</p>

## What is that Storage?

<p>Although we cannot see with our two eyes, enormous data are continuously traveling around through the LAN wires.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0;">All the data are stored in a place called the data center, which is country and companies have several or dozens of them.</p>

<p>The data center is never turned off, and because they infinite heats, lots of coolers are activated as well.</p>

To run the data center and the cooler, they use 32kwh of energy for 1GB of storage.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Coming back to the e-mail part, 50 e-mails deleted by each user around the world can save 8,423TB, which means it saves 276,000,000kwh energy.</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 24; display:inline-block;">"</h1>
<p style="display:inline-block;">It is as if turning off 2.7 billion lights for 1 hour.</p>
